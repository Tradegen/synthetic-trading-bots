# Synthetic Trading Bots

Synthetic trading bots tokenize the performance of trading algos in simulated trades. This enables high-frequency trading on-chain with zero exchange fees and slippage.

Trades are simulated on our own blockchain in response to price updates from Band Protocol oracles. Simulated orders are passed to the BotPerformanceOracle contract through a dedicated oracle.

Bot token positions are NFTs that return deposited collateral linearly over 365 days. These NFTs are tradable on the platform's marketplace.
